For example, exercise 1 is described in `test_exercise_01.py` and exercise 2 is described in `test_exercise_02.py`. Each exercise may have sub-parts in them. Each subpart is worth 1 point. The total points available for the assignment can be obtained by summing the number of subparts across all exercises.

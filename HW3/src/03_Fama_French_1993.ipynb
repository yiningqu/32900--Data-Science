    "# HW Guide Part B: Replicate Fama-French 1993\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Fama and French (1993) paper, \"Common Risk Factors in the Returns on Stocks and Bonds,\" revolutionized asset pricing theory by challenging the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) with a three-factor model that includes market risk, size (market capitalization), and book-to-market value as predictors of stock returns. They demonstrated that the market factor alone does not fully explain stock returns and that small stocks and stocks with high book-to-market ratios yield higher returns than can be explained\n",
    "by market beta alone, suggesting that these factors capture additional risks not accounted for by the CAPM. This seminal work has significantly influenced academic research and investment practices by highlighting the importance of size and value factors in asset pricing, thereby laying the groundwork for more sophisticated models and strategies in finance.\n",
    "\n",

    "The code underlying this notebook follows the methodology described in https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/pages/wrds-research/applications/risk-factors-and-industry-benchmarks/fama-french-factors/ . I will quote from that methodology extensively. There is also a set\n",

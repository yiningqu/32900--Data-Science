    "# Example: Connecting to the WRDS Platform With Python\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The `wrds` Python package is a tool designed to facilitate data retrieval from the Wharton Research Data Services (WRDS) database. \n",
    " \n",
    "- It provides direct access to the WRDS database, allowing users to programmatically query and retrieve data. \n",
    "- The package supports a simple Python API as well as the ability to send raw SQL queries.\n",
    "- Retrieved data can be easily converted into Pandas DataFrames.\n",
    "- Secure access to the WRDS database is managed through user authentication, ensuring data security and compliance with usage policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "The package can be installed via pip:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install wrds\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To use the package, one would typically import it in Python, authenticate with WRDS credentials, and then proceed with data queries and analysis. This notebook walks through some of these basic features.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some helpful links to learn how to use the `wrds` Python package:\n",
    "\n",
    " - [Video: Using Python on the WRDS Platform](https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/pages/grid-items/using-python-wrds-platform/)\n",
    " - [PyPI Homepage for WRDS Python Package](https://pypi.org/project/wrds/)\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Import and Establish Connection\n",
    "\n",
    "Establish connection with WRDS server. \n",
    "Log in using your WRDS username and password.\n",
    "Set up a `pgpass` file to store the info. This will allow you to access WRDS without supplying your password each time, as long as you supply your username (which we are doing below via environment variables). We want to be able to access WRDS without a password so that we can automate the query."
